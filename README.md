# Spotify.me
This project is intended to be a personal assistant for (my) various Spotify needs that cannot be fulfilled through user-facing features, or that are simply too tedious to fulfill manually.

For my music library (size = ~5,608), creating one of the throwback playlists takes ~2min38sec, where almost all of the time is spent retrieving the user's saved tracks (i.e. my saved tracks).
